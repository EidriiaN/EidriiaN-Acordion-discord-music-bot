- Simple help command (`!help`).
- Automatically leaves the voice channel when empty or inactive for a set period.
- Uses embeds for a cleaner user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

1.  **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Version 16.9.0 or higher is recommended (LTS versions like v18 or v20 are ideal).
2.  **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (Node Package Manager): Usually comes bundled with Node.js. You can use `yarn` as an alternative.
3.  **Discord Bot Account**:
    - Create a new application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    - Create a Bot user within the application.
    - Note down the **Bot Token** (Keep this secret!).
    - Note down the **Client ID** (found on the "General Information" page).

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Get the Code:** Place the `index.js` and `package.json` files in a dedicated directory for your bot (e.g., `EidriiaN-Acordion-discord-music-bot`).

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt in the bot's project directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    _This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the required libraries (discord.js, @discordjs/voice, ytdl-core, etc.) into a `node_modules` folder._

3.  **Configure the Bot:**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your bot token to this file:
      ```env
      # .env file
      TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
      ```
    - (Optional) You can also set a custom command prefix in the `.env` file. If not set, it defaults to `!`.
      ```env
      # Optional: Change the default '!' prefix
      # PREFIX=?
      ```
    - **Important:** Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with the actual token you got from the Discord Developer Portal. **Never share your token!**

## Running the Bot

Once installation and configuration are complete, you can start the bot using:

```bash
npm start
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in your console like `ðŸš€ Logged in as YourBotName#1234`.

## Usage

1.  **Invite the Bot:** You need to invite the bot to your Discord server. Use a tool like the [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) or manually generate an invite link. You'll need your bot's **Client ID**.

    - **Required Permissions:** Ensure the bot has the following permissions in the channels you want it to operate in:
      - `View Channel`
      - `Send Messages`
      - `Embed Links`
      - `Connect` (Voice)
      - `Speak` (Voice)
      - `Read Message History` (Needed for button interactions to work reliably)
      - `Use External Emojis` (Optional, for button emojis)

2.  **Using Commands:** Once the bot is in your server and running, you can use commands in a text channel. The default prefix is `!`. For example:
    - `!help` - Shows the list of commands.
    - `!play <YouTube URL or Search Term>` - Plays a song or adds it to the queue. You must be in a voice channel first!

## Commands

Here are the available commands (Default Prefix: `!`):

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot joins but no sound / Not responding:**
  - Double-check the bot's permissions in the channel and server settings (`Connect`, `Speak`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`).
  - Ensure you haven't muted the bot within Discord (Right-click the bot user -> Uncheck Mute).
  - Try having the bot leave and rejoin the channel (`!stop`, wait a few seconds, then `!play`).
  - Check the console where the bot is running for any potential error messages.
